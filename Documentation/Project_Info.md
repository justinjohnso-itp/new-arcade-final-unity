# Project Information: SENDER

## Project Description (for show website and project wall text)

"SENDER" is a fast-paced arcade game that challenges players to navigate an endless, procedurally generated isometric cityscape. As a delivery driver, your mission is to pick up and deliver packages to their correct destinations while skillfully avoiding a relentless onslaught of obstacles. The game's difficulty dynamically increases over time, pushing your reflexes and strategic thinking to the limit.

With each successful delivery, your score climbs, but so does the speed and complexity of the urban sprawl. Collisions will cost you precious lives, but high scores can earn you extras, extending your run. The core experience is a thrilling test of endurance and precision, wrapped in a retro-inspired visual and audio package. Can you master the chaotic streets, keep your delivery streak alive, and etch your name onto the high score board? Prepare for an addictive, "just one more try" experience where every run is a new challenge.

## What is your project about?

"SENDER" is an endless arcade game where you pilot a delivery vehicle through a hazard-filled isometric city, testing your reflexes and decision-making to achieve the highest score.

## What does your project do technically?

Developed in Unity/C#, SENDER features procedural level generation for endless gameplay, an isometric perspective, and dynamic difficulty scaling that resets on reload. It includes analog player controls (via a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller), a scoring/lives system with extra lives at thresholds, and local high score persistence via PlayerPrefs. The game uses an event-driven architecture.

## How will people engage with your project?

Players use custom analog controls—a steering wheel for navigation and an analog button (interfacing as spacebar input) to manage their package inventory—to navigate SENDER's isometric city. The core gameplay involves delivering packages, avoiding obstacles, and chasing high scores, which are saved locally. The experience is designed to be intuitive yet challenging, encouraging replay for better performance.
